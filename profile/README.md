## 🔍 What is Warzone Wallhack?

A *Wallhack*, also known as ESP (Extra Sensory Perception), is a cheat that shows enemy players, loot, killstreaks, vehicles, and more — all through solid objects like walls, buildings, smoke, and terrain.

In Warzone, this means:

* Spotting snipers before they ADS
* Clearing campers without even entering rooms
* Knowing which direction enemies are rotating
* Playing like a UAV is always on

It’s perfect for aggressive players, sneaky flanks, or anyone tired of being in the dark.
